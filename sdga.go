/*
This file defines the core components of the State-Dependent Geometric Algebra (SDGA)
Simulation engine, based on the concepts from the PRISM project.

- Multivector: Represents a physical state (Ψ), defined by its Geometry and Energy.
- SDGA_Operator: An interface for dynamic transformations (like Genesis, Quench)
that operate on Multivectors over time.
