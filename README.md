# SDGA Simulation and Visualization Engine Written in Go
Simulate cybernetic regulation of a system underpinned 
by quantum mechanics. Operators over states (transformations between stable states).

⚠️  This is a complete rewrite of quinarymcgraphics.

1. CLI
2. Core Architecture: The Go SDGA Engine
- Build the simulation's "physics".
    * Establish the Stable Multivectors (**Ψ₀**, **Ψ₁**, **Ψₚ**).
    * Establish the Transformative Operators (**𝐺**, **𝑄**, **𝑃**).
3. Markov Chain: The Cybernetic Driver
- The MC will be the "driver" of the SDGA simulation.
4. Visualizing The Simulation: The GenerateGraphic Function
- Function to graphically render the history of the simulation.
5. ML: Learn the "Engergy Gradient".
- Use K-Means to find 5 dominant colors, and define the energy-to-color gradient.
